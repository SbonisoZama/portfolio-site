## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio was built to serve as the central hub of my software engineering journey — featuring conceptual, self-built projects that simulate real-world system challenges.  
It demonstrates my focus on **backend systems**, **infrastructure**, **security principles**, and **low-level programming**, all wrapped into a clean and efficient developer portfolio experience.

The website itself reflects my engineering philosophy: **minimalist, functional, and focused on systems thinking**.
